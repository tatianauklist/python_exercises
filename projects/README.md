# Python Projects

A collection of portfolio projects built while learning Python fundamentals. Each project focuses on practical applications and demonstrates progressive skill development.

## Projects

### 1. Contact Book
A command-line contact management system for storing and organizing contact information.

**Key Skills:** Nested dictionaries, functions, loops, user input handling

**Status:** In Progress

---

This repository tracks my progress as I move from Python fundamentals into building complete, functional applications. Each project builds on concepts from previous work while introducing new challenges.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Data structures (dictionaries, lists, nested structures)
- Functions and code organization
- User interaction and input validation
- File I/O and data persistence
- Problem-solving through practical applications

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.13
- Git & GitHub for version control
- JSON for data storage
- Command-line interface development

## Progress Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Completed MOOC Python fundamentals, focused on functions
- **Week 3:** Contact Book project development


## About

I'm a self-taught developer who learns best by building things that break, fixing them, and understanding why they broke in the first place.

After completing Python fundamentals, I realized I was just memorizing syntax without really *getting it*. So I shifted to project-based learning - tackling real-world problems from scratch with no hand-holding, just documentation, determination and AI clarifying some topics.

This repository documents that progression. Each project represents a deliberate step up in complexity and a problem I didn't quite know how to solve when I started. Some of the early code makes me cringe now (which means I'm learning). The goal isn't perfection - it's momentum, genuine understanding, and building functional software that actually works.

**My approach:** Start with a challenge slightly beyond my current skill level, figure it out through research and experimentation, then build something even more ambitious. Focus on clean, readable code and practical applications over academic exercises.

**The bigger picture:** This is the foundation. I'm building toward serverless architecture on AWS, production-ready applications, and a career creating systems that scale. Every project here is proof of concept - both of the software and of my ability to learn, adapt, and deliver.

Three weeks ago I could barely write a working function. Now I'm building working applications. This is just the beginning.
