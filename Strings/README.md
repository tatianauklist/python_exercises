# 🧵 String Manipulation Exercises

A collection of Python exercises focused on string manipulation and processing, completed as part of my learning journey through the MOOC.fi Introduction to Programming course.

## 📖 About

These exercises reinforce fundamental string operations in Python, including:
- String methods (upper, lower, find, replace, etc.)
- String indexing and slicing
- String formatting
- Input validation
- Pattern matching and searching

## 💻 Exercises

### Basic String Manipulation
1. **Name Formatter** ✏️ - Transforms and analyzes user's full name (case conversion, character counting, initial extraction) ✅
2. **Email Username Extractor** 📧 - Parses email addresses to extract username portions ✅
3. **Palindrome Checker** 🔄 - Determines if words read the same forwards and backwards ✅

### Intermediate Challenges
4. **Word Counter** 🔢 - Counts words in sentences with proper whitespace handling ✅
5. **Censorship Tool** 🚫 - Replaces specified words with asterisks ✅ 
6. **Password Validator** 🔐 - Checks password strength based on multiple criteria ✅ 

### Mini Projects
7. **Text-Based Adventure Start Screen** 🎮 - Creates personalized game intro with character codes ✅  
8. **Simple Cipher** 🔒 - Implements basic Caesar cipher encryption ✅ 

## 🚀 How to Run

Each exercise is contained in its own Python file. To run an exercise:

```bash
python3 exercise_name.py
```

## 🎯 Learning Goals

Through these exercises, I practiced:
- Working with string methods and built-in functions
- Understanding string immutability
- Implementing input validation
- Using loops and conditionals with strings
- Breaking down problems into smaller steps

## 📚 Course Information

These exercises are based on concepts from [MOOC.fi's Introduction to Programming](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/) course, specifically the "Working with Strings" section.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.13

## 🌱 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements I'm considering:
- Add unit tests for each exercise
- Create GUI versions of selected exercises
- Combine exercises into a larger text processing toolkit
- Add more advanced string algorithms
