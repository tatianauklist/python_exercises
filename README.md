## $whoami
I'm a self-taught developer who learns best by building things that break, fixing them, and understanding why they broke in the first place.

After completing Python fundamentals, I realized I was just memorizing syntax without really getting it. So I shifted to project-based learning - tackling real-world problems from scratch with no hand-holding, just documentation, determination and AI clarifying some topics.
